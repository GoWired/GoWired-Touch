# GoWired Touch
This is a repository for **GoWired Touch**, our new project of touch wall switches with embedded home automation modules. The software is fully open source.
The architecture of GoWired Touch is similar to the architecture of regular in-wall [GoWired modules](https://github.com/GoWired/GoWired-Project) in terms of both the hardware and installation issues.

GoWired Touch switches work with fingerprint resistant, mat glass panel provided by our partner. Multi-module glass panels are also possible, as well as panels for both switches and sockets.

Soon we are going to publish more info, especially about availability and pricing.

GoWired Touch features:
- Bus communication (RS485 & [MySensors](https://www.mysensors.org))
- Decentralized spatial architecture
- Easy configuration (no need of using any programming environments)
- Operating with lighting, roller shutters and DC dimmers up to 4 channels
- Reporting power usage data
- Compatible with many open source home automation controllers, such as [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io)
- Modern, minimalistic & elegant design
